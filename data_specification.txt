This is the standard data format we use for collecting data from the STM board:



Current model:
________________________________________________________________________________
10 bytes tx |  2 bytes angle | 500 bytes intensity values   | 2 bytes checksum
________________________________________________________________________________



Feel free to update the above model as needed. As of 9/18/19 it is not set in stone.
